# Fresh workspace handoff

Epiphany remains a supervised engineering alpha. Starfire is the cognition and
release forge; Yggdrasil is the small live crossing host and is not a build
machine at its current memory budget.

## Live causal boundary

The operator grants standing authority for bounded supervisor repair of
corrupted Epiphany runtime state. Repairs must be labeled, receipted, preserve
immutable worker evidence, and use exact compare-and-swap revision authority.

Commit `7093a8b9` supplies that narrow primitive for the legacy accepted Modeling
result which predated the typed future-frontier invariant. Revision 49 was
sealed before correction at
`sealed-evidence/v53-pre-modeling-acceptance-correction/runtime-revision-49.cc`,
76,172,850 bytes, SHA-256
`5ec47d8da386976dbb8ca1b18f214507de3c14eb4f02d31bdc3aa60d99e612f3`.

Correction
`supervisor-acceptance-correction-e2ddbf239ea45081138ad9f10089f6895887fe14130b431aab0fef1d1978004c`
removed only obsolete acceptance
`accept-modeling-result-worker-4e6b6022-73ab-49f1-81c8-03dddfceb29f`, retained
its immutable result and admitted RepoModel, and recorded prior receipt hash
`2f1af810e77997e2bf235e779609da62ec1a5148107d81a342288005e80df510`.
The old result was then reviewed under current policy and superseded as
`role-failure-review-a35d6548-ec90-48c6-80d5-84ac6e32c619`.

Fresh Modeling job `ca61f378-4998-4911-a565-06d77388bb4a` was accepted as
`accept-modeling-result-worker-ca61f378-4998-4911-a565-06d77388bb4a` with
evidence `ev-modeling-4a0caaa3-9172-44eb-a9e9-9ea68c6406fc`. It minted exactly
one active typed Imagination frontier,
`frontier-native-frontier-minimal-route-chain-design-20260808`.

Self routed that frontier over the stale display-level `regatherManually`
recommendation:

1. planning request `repo-frontier-planning-7adf9c5863cd3ca640086f9aafd1abd910aa8d28e40dcc6e08835a20af60a9aa` at revision 53;
2. completed Imagination job `2a5701fe-7fbe-4f29-b3a5-51d6e790acbd` and typed candidate `repo-frontier-plan-candidate-02c089eb385c27560252d1915b998efc7c800324971a7b915b6e9ff3d33e4646` at revision 54;
3. dedicated Mind request `repo-frontier-plan-mind-7c8f086d050fe458a298ea4d9f5202e446530e5e14fa10129f52b4ae72238bc3` at revision 55, without adoption or Hands authority.

The next live typed action is `launchMindPlanReview`.

## Build-time finding

Commit `0f0b006d` made the three named owner manifests drive separate locked Cargo
builds. Focused tests passed, but the real benchmark falsified the design:

- the new aggregate owner-lock identity forced a cold graph namespace;
- the core owner group took 8m02s;
- the OpenAI runtime group then resolved its own dependency graph and began
  compiling `epiphany-core` a second time;
- the run was terminated at 16m53s before the tool-runtime group could repeat
  the wound;
- logs are `.epiphany-run/package-0f0b006d-owner-groups-attempt2.*`;
- pushed commit `a1a43892` reverts the implementation.

Do not resurrect separate owner lock universes. The next design must retain one
shared Cargo dependency graph while moving volatile Self policy and its
coordinator/status consumers out of the stable core compilation unit. A policy
crate re-exported through `epiphany-core` would preserve the invalidation edge
and is not a split.

## Current performance evidence

- Exact `c35272c9` warm packaging of 21 binaries: 2m34s.
- Release-publisher bootstrap after a core edit: 4m11s.
- Fresh Modeling context: state load 121ms, dynamic context 107ms.
- Fresh Modeling job commit: 51.637s; coordinator total 51.865s.
- The launch wound is the whole-store transaction, not context assembly.

## Open readiness work

- design and benchmark the single-Cargo-graph coordinator-policy crate split;
- launch and adjudicate the committed Mind plan review;
- prove native Persona cognition and external speech consequence;
- prove Continuity crash, restart, session closure, and bounded retention;
- measure long-duration resource plateau;
- profile and remove the Modeling whole-store commit path;
- prove Linux cognition on Starfire, then size Yggdrasil from measured demand.

Do not recreate prior Eyes, Hands, Soul, or Modeling work. Do not feed the old
manual-regather loop. Use coordinator projections and receipts; raw worker
thought remains sealed.
